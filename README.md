## Solving using AI
- This is only a simple example of how you can use speech recognition / WhisperX to solve an AWS WAF captcha in roughly 5 seconds (could be less depending on provider of your WhisperX).
- Currently, its using my own hosted endpoint to recognize audio which I will leave in for free for anybody to test, however it's not the fastest as I mentioned.
- This is only a proof of concept, a real version ready for production would need more work.
